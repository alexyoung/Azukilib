h2. AzukiLib

!http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/221414/blogs/logo.gif!

This library provides useful JavaScript classes for dealing with:

* Popup windows, lightboxes, "busy" feedback messages
* Contextual help
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Form enhancements for searching selects, adding resizers to textareas
* "Controller" abstraction, to help you encapsulate your JavaScript behaviour for sections on your site
* Loading and management of "remote forms" - create/edit/delete forms hosted on your server that you want to display as a popup with Ajax

It also provides pre-processor scripts for integrating the library with your project.

The aims of this library are:

* To unite the reusable JavaScript in my applications
* To improve the encapsulation in JavaScript code
* To make the relationship between the application and JavaScript more obvious
* To provide a rich set of tools for enhancing web applications

AzukiLib is comprised of:

* JavaScript classes
* A set of images for icons and feedback messages
* Example CSS
* Unit tests
* Rake tasks for producing a single library file (with boilerplate comments removed), and installing the css, images and javascripts into your project

This library depends on Prototype (http://www.prototypejs.org/).

h2. Usage

You can use the JavaScript files in src/ in part or the entire thing as azukilib.js.  Build azukilib.js like this:

rake azukilib:compile

The config.yml file is expected to contain various settings, including:

* The location of your project which you're going to use Azuki with.
* Locations for your project's CSS, images and JavaScript files.
* insert_css: Add Azuki's CSS to your project's CSS file (rather than loading multiple files to cut down the number of remote requests).  CSS already added by Azuki will be replaced.
* image_relative: Azuki's pre-processor will replace image paths in azuki.css and azukilib.js so you can keep Azuki's example images separate to your project's images.
